## Notes

### Big O Notation - Time complexity

- the time needed (number of steps) to run an algorithm as the input increases

#### O(1)

- constant time
- no matter how big the input becomes the algorithm takes the same amount of time
- accessing data in an array,map or set

#### O(N logN)

- linear logarithmic complexity
- the size of the input reduces in each step of the algorithm
- sorting algorithms and sorted dictionaries

#### O(N)

- linear complexity
- as input size grows the runtime grows linearly
- iterating over an array or retrieving an element in a linked list

#### O(N^2)

- quadratic
- it takes N*N steps to complete the algorithm
- a nested loop
