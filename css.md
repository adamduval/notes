### components of css

```css
h1{
    color: blue;
    text-align: right;
}
```

- entire thing is a rule
- h1, selector
- {}, declaration block
- color: blue, individual declaration
- color, property
- blue, value

A CSS rule is a block of declarations which apply declaration properties and values to a selector.

### units

- ideally relative units will keep a site more responsive
- EM # TODO
- REM # TODO

### style

- use double quotes
- when a rule has multiple selectors put each selector on a new line with a comma

```css
h1,
h2,
h3 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: right;
}
```
