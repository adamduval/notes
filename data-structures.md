## Notes

### data structures

- can be linear or non linear
  - linear
    - elements are arranged sequentially, elements are attached to their previous and next elements
    - can be static or dynamic
      - linear / static
        - static structures have a fix memory size
        - cannot be altered during runtime, but easier to access
        - array
      - linear / dynamic
        - not a fixed size
        - can be updated while program is running
        - queue
        - stack
        - linked list
  - non linear
    - elements are not arrange sequentially
    - cannot traverse all elements in a single run
    - tree
    - graph

## arrays

- a structure of fixed size
- holds items of the same data type
- can store complex data with nD arrays
- items are indexed
- being indexed allows random access
- operations
  - traverse, go through the elements
  - reverse
  - search, find an element by value of index
  - update, updated an element by index
  - ! insert / delete cannot be done in a straightforward manner because of fixed size, a new array must be created
- applications
  - building block for other structures
  - algorithms
    - insertion sort
    - quick sort
    - bubble sort
    - merge sort
